# Encryption App

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a robust encryption app that utilizes a novel two-key encryption scheme to safeguard sensitive information. The app seamlessly encrypts messages locally employing a user-defined key, enabling secure communication without revealing the encryption key itself. To ensure enhanced security, the encryption key is encrypted and appended to the message as a header. Upon receiving the encrypted message, the app employs a separate key to decipher the original encryption key, which is then used to decrypt the entire message. This approach provides an additional layer of protection, ensuring that even if the encrypted header is compromised, the original message remains secure.
